# Energy Price Prediction Project

This project is developed by Ogunsanya James for the Optimus AI Labs Hackathon. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model and a user interface application for predicting energy prices. The dataset used for training the model was obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/electricity-prices?select=clean_data.csv).

## Overview

Energy price prediction is a crucial task for energy companies, policymakers, and consumers alike. Accurate predictions can help optimize energy production and consumption, leading to cost savings and improved resource management. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict energy prices based on historical data and relevant features.
